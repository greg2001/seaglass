= Usage =

To use the Sea Glass Look and Feel, you must either include our [http://maven.apache.org Maven] repository in your [http://maven.apache.org/pom.html pom.xml] file or download the jar file and include it in your path. See the [Downloads downloads] page for more details.

To enable the Sea Glass Look and Feel, include the following in your application before creating any controls:

{{{
        try {
            UIManager.setLookAndFeel("com.seaglasslookandfeel.SeaGlassLookAndFeel");
        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
}}}

We also support setting the UI on the command line using the VM option

{{{-Dswing.defaultlaf=com.seaglasslookandfeel.SeaGlassLookAndFeel}}}
